# Algolia Search & Discovery for Salesforce B2C Commerce

Algolia's cartridge unlocks best-in-class Search & Discovery on Salesforce B2C Commerce.

It can be used for synchronization of product (incl. price and inventory information), category and content data, and includes native storefront cartridges to power Search & Discovery Experiences on both [SFRA (Storefront Reference Architecture)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/sfra/guide/sfra-overview.html) and SiteGenesis.
It also is compatible with Headless/Composable storefront integrations, such as the [PWA Kit](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/getting-started.html), thanks to Algolia's developer-friendly [InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/react/), [Autocomplete](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ui-libraries/autocomplete/introduction/what-is-autocomplete) and [Recommend](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ui-libraries/recommend/introduction/getting-started/) UI libraries.
The integration can be used in conjunction with Algoliaâ€™s rich suite of Search & Discovery products such as its user-friendly [Merchandising Studio](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/) and [Search Analytics](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/search-analytics/overview/), powerful [AI Search](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/neuralsearch), [Personalization](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/personalization/what-is-personalization/) and [Recommend](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/algolia-recommend/overview/).
